He denationalized several state-owned enterprises, returning them to original owners or selling them to private investors to foster efficiency. Investment ceilings were raised, and the stock market was reactivated to encourage capital formation. This policy aimed to create a mixed economy where the private sector could thrive alongside the public sector. Special incentives were provided for foreign direct investment, signaling a welcoming stance to the global market. These reforms were crucial in transitioning the country from a stagnant, aid-dependent economy to one capable of generating internal growth.",

The number was raised from 30 to 45, aiming to enhance female political representation. This move was designed to ensure that women's voices were better heard in the legislative process. While the method of selection (proportional representation) was debated, the increase in numbers was a step towards greater political empowerment for women. It reflected the state's commitment to gender equity in governance.",

This was a pioneering move globally to address drainage clogging and soil pollution. Additionally, the administration mandated the conversion of commercial vehicles to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) to combat air pollution in Dhaka. These policies were enforced strictly with mobile courts and fines. The measures resulted in a visible improvement in the urban environment and air quality.",

These shelters were designed to serve as schools or community centers during normal times and safe havens during natural disasters. The initiative was part of a broader strategy to reduce casualties from cyclones and storm surges. Coupled with an improved early warning system, this infrastructure development significantly lowered the death toll in subsequent storms. It demonstrated a proactive approach to climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction.",
